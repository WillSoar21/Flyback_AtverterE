r1: created project for collaboration between schematic file and PCB file. Several footprints were missing or not linked, will need to be addressed in r2 
r2: added the rest of the components, assigned proper nets and updated components
changed xtal oscillator to 4-pad version (may not be connected correctly on schematic)
r3: added footprint for R2, cleaned schematic a little and updated board (NEED to add optocoupler) 
r4: mostly finished initial layout of components

***IMPORTANTE: DO NOT USE PLACEHOLDER COMPONENTS OR ZONES WILL NOT FILL***
KiCAD sucks

r5: finished mostly unrouted layout of PCB
